How you choose to capture addresses depends on what you want to do with them and which geographical regions you need to support. We'll discuss three approaches here:

1. **[Free text box](#free-text-box)**
2. **[Multiple fields](#multiple-fields)**
3. **[Address finder](#address-finder)**

<h2 class="heading-36" id="free-text-box">1. Free text box</h2>

A single, multi-line text box where users write out the address in full.

<div class="example">

  <form class="form">
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="ex1-address" class="form-label">Full address</label>
      <textarea type="text" id="ex1-address" class="form-control" rows="5"></textarea>
    </div>
  </form>

</div>

<h3 class="heading-24">Pros</h3>

* It can handle any possible address format
* People can copy and paste addresses from the clipboard
* People don't have to work out which part of the address goes in which field

<h3 class="heading-24">Cons</h3>

* Parsing addresses for sub-parts (region, street etc.) is hard, and impossible to do with 100% accuracy
* Many legacy back-end systems expect multi-field addresses

<h3 class="heading-24">Guidance</h3>

Use when you're expecting a very broad range of address formats and you don't need to use specific sub-parts of the address.


<h2 class="heading-36" id="multiple-fields">2. Multiple fields</h2>

The address is broken down into multiple fields. Here's an example that works for simple UK addresses:

<div class="example">

  <form class="form">
    <div class="form-group form-group-compound">
      <label for="ex2-street-address" class="form-label">Street address</label>
      <input type="text" id="ex2-street-address" class="form-control">
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="ex2-street-address-2" class="visuallyhidden">Street address line 2</label>
      <input type="text" id="ex2-street-address-2" class="form-control">
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="ex2-town" class="form-label">Town or City</label>
      <input type="text" id="ex2-town" class="form-control">
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="ex2-county" class="form-label">County (optional)</label>
      <input type="text" id="ex2-county" class="form-control">
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="ex2-postcode" class="form-label">Postcode</label>
      <input type="text" id="ex2-postcode" class="postcode form-control">
    </div>
  </form>

</div>


<h3 class="heading-24">Pros</h3>

* You can easily extract the parts of an address and do things with them
* You can give help for or validate each part of the address separately
* Works well with browsers that have auto-complete enabled


<h3 class="heading-24">Cons</h3>

* Hard to find a single format that works for a broad range of regions
* No guarantee that people will use the fields as you intended
* Can't easily paste addresses from the clipboard

<h3 class="heading-24">Guidance</h3>

Only use multiple address fields when you know which regions the addresses will come from and can find a format that supports them all.

<h4 class="heading-19">UK addresses</h4>

* 'postcode' is written all one word
* let people enter postcodes with or without spaces
* avoid making individual fields mandatory (but warn users if they don't fill in any fields)
* Royal Mail do not need a county as long as the town and postcode are included
* include a county field though - it lets people who don't know their postcode give a valid address
* make the field lengths appropriate - it helps people understand the form


<h2 class="heading-36" id="address-finder">3. Address finder</h2>

Sometimes referred to as 'postcode lookup'. An address finder lets users specify a UK address by inputing their postcode (and optionally street name or number) and selecting the address from a list.

Here's how this pattern was implemented on the [Lasting Power of Attorney](https://lastingpowerofattorney.service.gov.uk/) service.

<div class="example">

 <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/guides/postcode-lookup.gif" title="An animation showing the address finder in the Lasting Power of Attorney service">

</div>

<h3 class="heading-24">Pros</h3>

* People entering UK addresses don't have to enter as much information
* Reduces the chance of mis-typed UK addresses

<h3 class="heading-24">Cons</h3>

* Requires greater effort to implement

<h3 class="heading-24">Guidance</h3>

* Make it clear that the address finder only works for UK addresses
* Provide a manual option for people with international adresses or addresses that are missing or badly formed in the Royal Mail database
