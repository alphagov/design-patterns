This is the technique of hiding content on a page until a user interacts with it in some way. Done well it:

* keeps a page focussed and uncluttered
* delivers targeted content to those people who need it
* reduces the [cognitive load](http://usabilityfriction.com/2010/11/22/cognitive-load/) on your users

However, be careful not to hide important content from people or force them to interact needlessly with the page. If a majority of users need that content, *don't hide it*.



### Details and summary tags

In HTML5, the 'details' and 'summary' tags can be used like this:

<div class="pattern-example">

    <details>
      <summary>What happens if I click on a summary tag?</summary>
      <p>The remaining contents of the details tag are revealed</p>
    </details>

</div>

Cross browser support for these tags is [still patchy](http://caniuse.com/details), but you can plug the gap with JavaScript. [This jQuery plugin](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-details) does just that, whilst also adding appropriate ARIA roles to the elements.

#### Writing good summary text

Good summary text is critical, because you're hiding content from users. It needs to directly reference the needs of the users for whom the content is intended. As always, verbs are powerful, but so is framing the text in the users own voice.

Some examples: 

* 'What if I don't have a passport?'
* 'Add another address'
* 'Show details'

Some users are reluctant to click on summary text for fear that they will be taken to another screen and lose whatever information they've already provided. A consistent visual treatment (like the 'â–º' bullet above) can help, as can using strong action words like 'add' or 'show'.


### Progressive disclosure in forms

Used carefully, progressive disclosure can improve the user experience of forms by hiding those parts of the form that the user doesn't need to complete.

Remember though:

* try to simplify the form so you don't need to use this technique
* don't hide parts of the form that must be completed
* the service must still work when JavaScript is not available
