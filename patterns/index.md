If you're designing or building services for GOV.UK this library can help you.
It contains guidance and examples for some of the more common design problems.
If you'd like to discuss a pattern or suggest a new one you can do this on the [design patterns wiki](https://designpatterns.hackpad.com/Pattern-library-0eUk1OdHvql).

####The guide

* [GOV.UK design guide](design-guide.html)

####The patterns

* [Addresses](addresses.html)
* [Buttons](buttons.html)
* [Date of birth](date-of-birth.html)
* [People's names](peoples-names.html)
* [Progress indicators](progress-indicator.html)
* [Progressive disclosure](progressive-disclosure.html)
* [User registration](user-registration.html)

## How to use this library

1. Don't use a pattern unless there's a genuine need for it
2. Try the patterns here before creating your own versions
3. If they don't work for your users, change them until they do
4. [Let us know](https://designpatterns.hackpad.com/Pattern-library-0eUk1OdHvql) if you use or change a pattern

## Code examples

All the code for the examples in this library is [available on Github](https://github.com/alphagov/design-patterns) and linked to from each pattern page.
This code should be considered a starting point for your own designs. It's not supported by GDS and you'll need to integrate it into your service in the most appropriate way.
