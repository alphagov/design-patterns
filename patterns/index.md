* [People's names](peoples-names.html)
* [Progress indicators](progress-indicator.html)
* [Progressive disclosure](progressive-disclosure.html)

## How to use this library

1. Don't use a pattern unless there's a genuine need for it
2. Try the patterns here before creating your own versions
3. If they don't work for your users, change them until they do
4. Lets us know if you use or change a pattern, so we can share
