## How to use the patterns in this library


### 1. If you don't need it, don't use it

Each element you add to a page takes away from the overall simplicity of the design. Only use a pattern if it addresses a genuine user need that you've identified with research.

Remember the GOV.UK design principles: 'Do less' and 'Design with data'.


### 2. If you do need it, do use it

Conversly, if there's a pattern in the library that does meet some of your user needs, please use it. We're aiming for consistency across all GOV.UK services, which means we don't want seven slightly different versions of a progress bar.

If you use a pattern, tell us so we can link to it from the library (if GitHub's your thing, just do a pull request). This will help other designers understand how it should be implemented.


### 3. If it doesn't work for your users, change it

We held off creating a pattern library for a while, because we wanted designers to come up with the best solutions for the problems in front of them, rather than just using an off-the-shelf approach.

Now that many of our exemplar projects are moving out of the discovery and alpha phases we feel this is a good time to look across the exemplars and consolidate some of our efforts.

However, there's always more we can learn. If you find that a pattern isn't working for you and you find a way to improve it, please do so. Let us know, ideally by blogging about it - then we can all benefit from what you've discovered.

Remember: 'Consistent not uniform'
