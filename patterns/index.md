If you're designing or building services for GOV.UK this library can help you.
It contains guidance and examples for some of the more common design problems.
If you'd like to suggest a new pattern you can do so on the [design patterns wiki](https://designpatterns.hackpad.com/Pattern-library-0eUk1OdHvql).

####The guide

* [GOV.UK design guide](design-guide.html)

####The patterns

* [Addresses](addresses.html)
* [Buttons](buttons.html)
* [Date of birth](date-of-birth.html)
* [People's names](peoples-names.html)
* [Progress indicators](progress-indicator.html)
* [Progressive disclosure](progressive-disclosure.html)
* [User registration](user-registration.html)

## How to use this library

1. Don't use a pattern unless there's a genuine need for it
2. Try the patterns here before creating your own versions
3. If they don't work for your users, change them until they do
4. Lets us know if you use or change a pattern, so we can share 

## Code examples

All the code for the examples in this library is [available on Github](https://github.com/alphagov/design-patterns).
This code should be considered a starting point for your own designs. It's not supported by GDS and you'll need to integrate it into your service in the most appropriate way.
