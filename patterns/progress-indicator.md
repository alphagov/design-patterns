## The problem

As users interact with a multi-page transaction they can sometimes become disorientated or unsure of how much further there is to go.

## The solution

Tell your users where they are in the transaction. Here are some ways of doing this:


What do people think of these? Any preferences?


## To test

Q: Are users confused if the number of steps changes as they progress through the transaction?

Q: Circles vs. lines - is it purely aesthetic or does it affect usability?

Q: Progress bars as navigation - good idea? bad idea?


## When to use one

If your users are dropping out out of the transaction early because they think they've finished when they haven't.

Use one of these if:
- the transaction is long enough that users need reassurance to continue
- the transaction contains a fixed number of steps
- the steps are best completed in a certain order

Don't use one of these if:
- Your transaction only consists of a few screens
- There's no evidence that users are struggling without one
