<h2 class="heading-36">Design style guide</h2>

This guide explains how to style and arrange the basic elements like like headings, paragraphs, images, form fields and buttons.

* [Read the design style guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/design-style-guide.html)
* [Take a look through the design style guide examples]({{ site.baseurl }}/example/)


<h2 class="heading-36">Design patterns</h2>

The basic elements can be combined into patterns which address a specific user need.
Here are four simple design patterns to get started with:

* [Addresses]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/addresses.html)
* [Date of birth]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/date-of-birth.html)
* [People's names]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/peoples-names.html)
* [Progress indicators]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/progress-indicator.html)

<h3 class="heading-24">How to use the design patterns</h3>

1. Don't use a pattern unless there's a genuine user need for it
2. Try the patterns here before creating your own versions
3. The [example code](https://github.com/alphagov/design-patterns/tree/gh-pages/assets/sass/design-patterns) is a starting point - make it your own
3. If the patterns don't work for your users, change them until they do
4. [Let us know](https://designpatterns.hackpad.com/Pattern-library-0eUk1OdHvql) if you use or change a pattern
